In light of shifting attitudes towards religion and politics amongst young adults within the United States, this study attempts to assess the relationship between religious indifference and being/leaning liberal and the marital decisions of the young. It employs data from all 50 states within the U.S. across four years (2011-2014) to conduct the analysis. Upon utilizing panel data OLS regression analysis upon demeaned data, the results indicate that religious apathy has no significant association with the marital decisions of the young. However, being/leaning liberal exhibited significant relationships with young marital decisions. It had a negative relationship with the marriage rate and a positive association with the divorce rate, for young adults, and the timing of first marriage. Additionally, upon constructing models that include several different religious groups to account for heterogeneity in religious identification, being liberal was found to be positively associated with divorce and religious non-affiliation (considered the most liberal group of all) was found to be negatively related with the young marriage rate. The overall findings indicate that political ideology affiliation might be playing a stronger role when it comes to marital decisions in contemporary American society, than religiosity.
